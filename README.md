# Python-Convert
My conversion to python

I'm a convert to python. And it's great fun. 

Previously I have used:
- FORTRAN
- Basic
- C/C++
- LabView
- JavaScript especially jQuery
- VBA especially in Excel

In this repository are some python code snippets that are from my journey to python.

You can play with them using Repl.it
